## ✨ Project Overview

The Tech Quiz Test Suite adds comprehensive automated testing to an existing MERN‑stack quiz app:

- **Component Tests** validate individual UI pieces (button clicks, question rendering).  
- **End‑to‑End Tests** simulate real user flows—starting the quiz, answering 10 questions, viewing scores, and restarting.  
- **Fixtures** provide consistent mock data for predictable results.  
- **Single‑Command Run** (`npm run test`) executes all suites headlessly or in the Cypress UI.
